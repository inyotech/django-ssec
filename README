WEATHER ANIMATION

Sample web application demonstrating animation using Javascript.
Processed weather images are downloaded regularly from the Space
Science Center at University of Wisconsin.  These images are saved in
a directory on the server.  The application will load the latest of
these images and display them in sequence resulting in an animation
effect.  The application also provides controls.

PROCESS

Images are downloaded using the retrieve Perl script and resized
using the GD Image manipulation module.  Since no time meta data
is provided with the image the image time is estimated and
encoded into the saved image file name.  The resized and renamed
image is saved to disk file.

Periodically, the clean_old Perl script is run to remove old images
from the system.

GUI WEB FRONTEND

The structure for the web application is accomplished with a Perl
script that uses the HTML::Template module.  The animation is created
using Javascript.  The user can stop/start/step the animation and
control the frame rate through a set of buttons that are rendered on
the page.
